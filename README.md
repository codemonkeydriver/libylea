##DESCRIPTION
cfylee's personal alogrithm library<br>
this is a alogrithm library that writen by c++, it is contain of basic data struct,
list,stack,tree,map.and some useful alogrithms,including basic sort alogrithm, tree 
alogrithm, map alogrithm, and some advanced alogrithms.<br>

###class Vecvots:
1.  operator=   "=" operator
2.  operator[]  "[]" operator
3.  resize()    reset the size of vector
4.  size()      return the size of vector
5.  reserve()   reset the capacity of the vector
6.  empty()     cleanup the contain of vector
7.  capacity()  return the capacity of the vector
8.  push_back() inserting an element
9.  pop_back()  pop an element
10. back()      return the back element of vector
11. begin()     return the first element of vector
12. end()       return the last element of vector

##TODO
data struct(tree, map)<br>
